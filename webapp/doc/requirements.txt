Our target user is someone who is already well versed with all of the game mechanics of Pokémon.

Story: 
1) As a user, I can search for any attribute that a Pokémon can have (name, index number, ability, type, etc.), so that I can get a list of all Pokémon with the given attribute. Then from that list, a Pokémon can be selected, and information specific to that given Pokémon is displayed.

2) As a user, I can sort by general information about a group of Pokémon such as what generation they belong to, what egg group they're in, if the Pokémon is legendary, etc. and display a list of all Pokémon that are part of that group.

Implementation:
1) We could have a search bar. Once the search term is entered, a new page is shown with the results of the search. Each Pokémon in the result list can be clicked on, and information about it can be viewed. We will only allow search strings to be entered with the exception of the index value of the Pokémon. So, for example, weight cannot be searched for.

2) On the home page, we could have links to general categories such as generations, egg groups, legendaries. When these links are clicked on, it will take the user to a page with a drop down menu. The drop down menus will allow the user to get a table of Pokémon that fit a subcategory. For example, if the user selects the egg group link, it will take them to a drop down menu with a list of all the egg groups. From there, the desired egg group can be selected, and Pokémon in that egg group can be viewed. For some categories, the user might want to view multiple subcategories at once, in this case we could allow multiple fields to be selected via check box and displayed all at once.
