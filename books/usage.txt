Description

	This is a program that will search through a CSV file to find and sort 
	information. It can search for titles, authors, and dates of publication.

	-h, --help
		Prints the synopsis and the list of commands.

	-t, --title-search
		Given a search string S, prints a list of books whose titles contain S 
		(case-insensitive). Books are sorted by title or publication year as 
		specified. If no sort method is specified, books will default to be sorted 
		by title. 
	
	-a, --author-search 
		Given a search string S, prints a list of authors whose names contain S 
		(case-insensitive). For each such author, prints a list of the author's 
		books. Authors are sorted alphabetically by surname. If there is a tie, 
		it will be broken by first/given name.

	-y, --year-search
		Given a range of years A to B, prints a list of books published between 
		years A and B, inclusive. Books are printed in order of publication year. 
		If year A is not provided, then any book published before or during year 
		B is printed. If year B is not provided, then any book published after or
		during year A are printed. If neither year A or B are provided, all books
		are printed.
