Description
	olympics.py is a program that will query an olympics database.

	athletes
		Prints a list of all athletes sorted by a given NOC abbreviation. If no 
		NOC is provided, no athletes will be printed. Search term is case
		insensitive.
	
	noc_medals
		Prints a list of all the NOCs and the number of gold medals they have won.
		Sorted in decreasing order by number of medals.
	
	top_athletes
		Prints a list of the top 81 athletes with the most gold medals ordered by 
		descending number of medals first, then by name alphabetically. (The top 
		81 are chosen because after that, there are ties for 4 gold medals, and it 
		seemed wrong to print an athlete just because their name is higher up in
		the alphabet.)
